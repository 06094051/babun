=== Cygwin

The core of Babun consists of a pre-configured Cygwin. Cygwin is a great tool, but there's a lot of quirks and tricks that makes you loose a lot of time to make it actually 'usable'. Not only does babun solve most of these problems, but also contains a lot of vital packages, so that you can be productive from the very first minute. 

=== Package manager

Babun provides a package manager called +pact+. It is similar to 'apt-get' or 'yum'. Pact enables installing/searching/upgrading and deinstalling cygwin packages with no hassle at all. Just invoke +pact --help+ to check how to use it.

=== Shell

Babun's shell is tweaked in order to provide the best possible user-experience. There are two shell types that are pre-configured and avaiable right away - bash and zsh (zsh is the default one). Babun's shell features:
* syntax highlighting
* unix tools
* software development tools
* git-aware prompt 
* custom scripts and aliases
* and much more!

=== Console

Mintty is the console used in babun. It features an +xterm-256+ mode, nice fonts and simply looks great!

=== Proxying

Babun supports HTTP proxying out of the box. Just add the address and the credentials of your HTTP proxy server to the +.babunrc+ file located in your home folder and execute +source .babunrc+ to enable HTTP proxying. SOCKS proxies are not supported for now.

=== Developer tools

Babun provides many packages, convenience tools and scripts that make your life much easier. The long list of features includes:
* programming languages (python, perl, groovy, etc.)
* git (with a wide variety of aliases and tweaks)
* unix tools (grep, wget, curl, etc.)
* oh-my-zsh
* custom scripts (pbcopy, pbpaste, babun, etc.)

=== Plugin architecture

Babun has a very small microkernel (cygwin, a couple of bash scripts and a bit of a convention) and a plugin architecture on the top of it. It means that almost everything is a plugin in the babun's world! Not only does it structure babun in a clean way, but also enables others to contribute small chunks of code. Currently, babun comprises of six plugins:
* cacert
* core
* git
* oh-my-zsh
* pact
* shell

=== Auto-update

Self-update is at the very heart of babun! Many Cygwin tools are simple bash scripts - once you install them there is no chance of getting the newer version in a smooth way. You either delete the older version or overwrite it with the newest one loosing all the changes you have made in between.

Babun contains an auto-update feature which enables updating both the microkernel and the plugins. Files located in your home folder will not be delted nor overwritten which preserves your local config and customizations.

=== Installer

Babun features an silent command-line installation script that may be executed without admin rights on any Windows hosts.
